The Snake Game is a classic arcade game implemented using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. The objective is to control a snake to eat food, grow longer, and avoid colliding with the walls or itself. The game features a responsive design for various screen sizes, score tracking, and a game restart functionality. To play, simply use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction and eat the food that appears on the screen. The game ends when the snake collides with its own body or the wall. You can restart the game by refreshing the page.
